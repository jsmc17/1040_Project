The goal of the project was originally to create a simple model that would estimate my 2018 federal tax liability and refund.
As I added more features, I realized that the complexity of US tax law meant that to model even my own simple taxes would mean a lot of time and effort. 
But when I realized how interesting it was to put together all the pieces, I endeavored to create a tool that could calculate all the moving parts of any return.
 
-Saved in this folder is a blank 1040 excel file, along with an example case “Guy Incognito”. 
-Saved in a separate folder are 1040 excel files for all 2020 presidential candidates that have released their 2018 tax returns (as of 2019/05/04), the 
corresponding 1040 pdf they released as part of their bid for office, and a file comparing the outputs for all candidates. 

Pages of the Model:
Home – enter personal information (filing status, overpayment options, date of birth, etc.…)
	-top right shows all forms and their status (activated or not activated)
	-expand income, deductions, other taxes, credits menus to show instructions for entering info
		-some amounts gathered from input forms can be overridden from the home screen

Mapping -Inputs from user go here, then are transferred to summary schedules (keeps data orderly)

1040 -Gathers inputs from other schedules and consolidates to show totals

Sum -Summary Page showing all outputs in order, can be easily compared with outputs of others

Orange Tabs -Enter info from W-2, 1099-INT, 1099-DIV, 1099-MISC, K-1 (1065) as it appears on form

Schedules 1-5 (formerly part of form 1040, but broken into separate schedules in 2018 due to TCAJA)
	-Additional income, adjustments to Income, tax, other taxes, credits shown on these schedules. Info taken from inputs on orange tabs and from home page and then output to 1040.

Schedules A-E
	-Schedule A gathers itemized deductions from home tab, calculates total and compares w. std deduction
	-Schedule B gathers interest income and dividend income info from 1099s
	-Schedule C – multiple schedule C forms in the tab. The first populates with nonemployee compensation from 1099-MISC. The others are reserved for self-reported business income.
	-Schedule D – must be filled out manually to calculate capital gains/losses
	-Schedule E – takes supplemental income inputs from 1099s and K-1

Other Schedules/Forms
	-Schedule SE – calculates self-employment tax based on inputs form SCH C and SCH E
	-Tax Calculation Forms
	-Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet 
	-Tax Computation Worksheet - for income greater than $100,000
	-Tax Table – for income less than $100,000
	-F6251 – Alternative Minimum Tax Calculation
